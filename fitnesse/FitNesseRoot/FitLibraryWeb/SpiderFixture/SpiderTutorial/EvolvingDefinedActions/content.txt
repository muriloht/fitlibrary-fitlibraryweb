!1 Part Three

Let's now see how ''defined actions'' need to evolve.

Consider the storytest from the previous tutorial:

|''define actions at''|..FitLibraryWeb.SpiderFixture.SpiderTutorial.DefinedActions.UsingDefinedActions.DefinedActions|

|''suite test on port''|${FITNESSE_PORT}|

|''check suite''|!-TemplateFixture-!|''passes''|

|''check suite''|!-XmlProcessing-!|''passes''|

We'd also like to use it to run the ''!-SpiderFixture-!'' storytests. We could try using:

|''check suite''|!-SpiderFixture-!|''passes''|

If you run that, however, you'll see that it fails. That's because .FitLibraryWeb.SpiderFixture is not a ''suite'' page, and that the suite we want to run is at .FitLibraryWeb.SpiderFixture.SpecifySpiderFixture.

We can't fix it by using the following:

|''check suite''|!-SpiderFixture.SpecifySpiderFixture-!|''passes''|

That's because the passing check is incorrect for two reasons (as shown in the expansion above after running this storytest):

 * The page name is incorrect
 * Some of the pages in the suite are ignored (some storytests are only run for a particular browser being used with ''!-SpiderFixture-!'')

So we need a variation on ''check suite passes'':

 * We need to pass in the "prefix" page as well
 * We need to ignore the ''ignored'' count

Let's do that [[on this page][^AddDefinedAction]].
