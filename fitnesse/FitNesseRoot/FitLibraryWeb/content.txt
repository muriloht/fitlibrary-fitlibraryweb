The fixtures (code and documentation) in FitLibraryWeb were kindly donated by '''Air New Zealand''' in October 2009.

It is based on developments by Rick Mugridge and others at '''Air New Zealand''' from May 2008 to October 2009.

FitLibraryWeb depends on ''!-FitLibrary-!'' and is now part of the ''!-FitLibrary-!'' open-source project.

It depends on jdk1.6 for ''com.sun.net.httpserver.*'' for Http servers.
